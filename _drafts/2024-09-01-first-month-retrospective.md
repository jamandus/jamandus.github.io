Introduction to first month.

### Lessons from "Modern Software Engineering" chapters

###### Chapter 4: Working iteratively
_Lesson_: "Fundamentally, iteration allows us to make mistakes and to correct them, or make advances and enhance them".
<br/>
_Comment_: Sounds like a lesson of life, you make choices which sometimes put you on your feet and other times you end up on your butt. 
Regardless, with open eyes and a reflective mind, you tend to see what makes you grow and excel. Do you have the courage to keep challenge yourself? 
To be philosophical, I like to think one should focus on learning, not because to avoid making mistakes but to lead a life of curiosity and seize new experiences.
Why would anyone blame someone for being bad at something new and when was it ever "not cool" to try??

If we hop into our initial topic again, agile thinking works in similar way according to David Farley. 
In contrast to waterfall thinking whereas focus lies on prediction, being agile means allowing exploration to take place.
Thinking agile means to start assuming that we will make mistakes, and safely to allow getting things wrong in order learn from them, the sooner, the better.

Reading this particular parts also points me in the direction of a classic Werner Vogels quote:
"Everything fails, all the time" where he touches on the subject of system design and emphasizes on designing with failure in mind.
Considering how often components fail, and that failure is inevitable, again, the sooner you would embrace failure, the better.

I also acknowledge that the reality for a lot of companies are not as straightforward, I've had experienced been up close with the struggles of a huge international company working agile within the boundaries of Scaled Agile Framework(SAFE).
With that being said, pushing for agile development in 2024 seems, but we all move in difference paces and I recognize that it is more than a decision away, the journey might take a while.
