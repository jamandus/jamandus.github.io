# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically, please restart the server process.

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
