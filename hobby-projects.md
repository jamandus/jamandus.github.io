<h3>Tekk-Fungi</h3>
<br/>An experimental project designed to practice and expand proficiency in Java and AWS cloud services. 
This project leveraging an array of AWS resources to build a mushroom-related ecosystem.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-mushroom-manor" class="static-link">Tekk-Mushroom-Manor:</a> A serverless database serving as the central repository for mushroom data, designed to store and provide information such as mushroom locations, while supporting batch actions and paginated scans.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-fungi-feed" class="static-link">Tekk-Fungi-Feed:</a> A serverless notification system built on a fanout pattern for efficient fungi data distribution. Utilizing AWS SNS and SQS, it routes messages to multiple subscribers, applying filtering rules and retry policies to ensure reliability. The system supports message delivery, enabling scalable, event-driven workflows for fungi-related data processing across multiple components.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-mycelium-maestro" class="static-link">Tekk-Mycelium-Maestro:</a> A serverless API serving as the gateway for mushroom data management, designed to handle interactions with a serverless database. It supports operations like saving mushroom data, while integrating usage quotas, throttling, and logging for efficient resource control.
