<h5>Dive into a series of experimental projects where I practice and grow my skills across various patterns, tools, and methodologies. 
Each component represents an interesting concept or aspect of developing cloud-based solutions.
From managing and securing mushroom data to designing scalable notification systems, I explore and document my findings here, in my learning journal.</h5>

<h3>Tekk-Fungi</h3>
<br/>An experimental project designed to practice and expand proficiency in Java and AWS cloud services. 
This project leveraging an array of AWS resources to build a mushroom-related ecosystem.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-mushroom-manor" class="static-link">Tekk-Mushroom-Manor:</a> A serverless database serving as the central repository for mushroom data, designed to store and provide information such as mushroom locations, while supporting batch actions and paginated scans.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-fungi-feed" class="static-link">Tekk-Fungi-Feed:</a> A serverless notification service built on a fanout pattern for fungi data distribution. The system supports message delivery to multiple subscribers, applying filtering rules and retry policies to ensure reliability.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-mycelium-maestro" class="static-link">Tekk-Mycelium-Maestro:</a> A serverless API serving as the gateway for mushroom data management, designed to handle interactions with a serverless database. It supports operations like saving mushroom data, while integrating usage quotas, throttling, and logging for efficient resource control.
- <a href="https://github.com/jamandus/tekk-spore-scrutinizer" class="static-link">Tekk-Spore-Scrutinizer:</a> An automated testing service designed to verify interactions between Tekk-Fungi components. It runs scheduled integration test suites, applies a BDD approach, and reports the results directly to Slack.
