Initially, I planned to write about renovating my apartment in Stockholm, as it was such a completely new experience in carpentry and building conservation.
However, I realized that diverging from the core themes immediately might not be the best introduction. 
The story of my old home, now up for sale, is well documented and something I might revisit in the future.

The entries in this learning journal are intended to share glimpses of my personal and professional growth journey. 
Publishing them will force me to be more vocal, reinforce what I learn and help ideas to sink in. 
This process encourages me to capture my insights and reflections along the way. 
Moreover, the journal serves as a living record, a structured way to track and revisit past lessons and experiences I have collected.

Before going any further, a huge Thank you to Martin Bäumer, https://mbaeumer.github.io/.
A brilliant colleague whose directness I really appreciate. He possesses the knack of cracking everyday jokes.

Martin often ends up helping me with various consultant issues, sometimes not entirely voluntarily, I must admit. 
He also inspired my first Christmas blog post in 2022, a tradition at Squeed, which I titled "Care for some DevOps?".

Every year, my consultancy firm publishes educational blog posts the days leading up to Christmas. 
I read and refleted on that year's State of DevOps Report from Google. 
Here's a preview from my contribution, which I will elaborate on in my next post. 

"As a fairly new member of Squeed and Software Engineer I sometimes face technical overload in our industry.
Adaptation to new tech is essential and a growth mindset coupled with speed is a winning strategy.

Attaining DevOps culture takes more time, longer than any innovation sprint.
It is a marathon where teams evolve by embracing new ways of working which involve deeper collaboration, refinement and communication between team members."
